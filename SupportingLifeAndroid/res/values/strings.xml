    <string name="about_intro">The Supporting LIFE project (Supporting Low-cost Intervention For disEase control) 
is designed to provide low-cost, effective, and targeted interventions in remote and resource-poor 
settings in order to overcome inadequate healthcare infrastructures in Malawi, Southern Africa. 
\n\nLed by Dr John O’Donoghue and Dr Joe Gallagher, Co-Directors of the Health Information Systems Research Centre (HISRC), 
Department of Business Information Systems, University College Cork, it includes a multinational group of experts, institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) 
in Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Malawi, and Switzerland. 
Supporting LIFE, which received over €3.6 million in funding from the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), 
applies a novel combination of smartphone technology, wireless body area network sensors and expert decision support systems
to equip the Ministry of Health’s front-line health-care workers in Malawi with mobile devices and applications to assist in their assessment, 
diagnosis and treatment of seriously ill children.
\n\nAdvancing technology and the subsequent ubiquitous use of mobile devices  
is an amazing feat and an often taken-for-granted luxury. People are 
connected - all the time - to and by some type of device. \n\nAccordingly, 
in an age when social networking and virtual connectivity may seem to 
bring out the anti-social aspects of us in real-world interpersonal settings, 
it is all the more refreshing and heart-warming that this innovative technology 
is being dedicated to the worthy and honourable cause of saving lives of 
children in developing countries.</string>
