    <!-- START: About Screen -->
    <string name="about_intro">Advancing technology and the subsequent ubiquitous use of mobile devices \n 
is an amazing feat and an often taken-for-granted luxury. People are \n
connected - all the time - to and by some type of device. Accordingly,\n
in an age when social networking and virtual connectivity may seem to \n
bring out the anti-social aspects of us in real-world interpersonal settings, \n
it is all the more refreshing and heart-warming that this innovative technology \n
is being dedicated to the worthy and honourable cause of saving lives of \n
children in developing countries.</string>
